<h1 id="first-five-minutes">5 Minutes Tutorial</h1>

<p>In this chapter you will learn how to create a new Xtext project, generate a fully working language infrastructure and how to start a new Eclipse instance in order to test the editor. But before we get started, make sure you have Eclipse Xtext properly installed.</p>

<h2 id="new-project">Creating A New Xtext Project</h2>

<p>The first step is to create a new Xtext project by choosing <em>File → New → Project…</em>. The dialog offers a couple of different project types. Select <em>New Xtext Project</em> from the category <em>Xtext</em> and finish the wizard with the default settings. You will find 4 new projects in your workspace which are mostly empty. The Xtext grammar editor will be opened and show the definition of a very simple <em>Hello World</em> language.</p>

<pre><code class="language-xtext">grammar org.xtext.example.mydsl.MyDsl with 
                                      org.eclipse.xtext.common.Terminals

generate myDsl "http://www.xtext.org/example/mydsl/MyDsl"

Model:
  greetings+=Greeting*;
  
Greeting:
  'Hello' name=ID '!';
</code></pre>

<p>The only thing this language does, is to allow to write down a list of greetings. The following would be proper input: </p>

<pre><code class="language-mydsl">Hello Xtext!
Hello World!
</code></pre>

<h2 id="run-workflow">Generating The Language Infrastructure</h2>

<p>In order to test drive this language, you will have to generate the respective language infrastructure. Therefore, choose <em>Run As → Generate Xtext Artifacts</em> from the context menu of the grammar editor. A new Java process will be spawned and afterwards you will find a couple of new files in the projects that were created in the first step. What you see now is a runnable language infrastructure with a powerful Eclipse editor for a brain-dead language :-).</p>

<h2 id="testing-the-editor">Try The Editor</h2>

<p>Let’s give the editor a try. If you select <em>Run As → Eclipse Application</em> from the project’s context menu, you can create a new Eclipse Application. A new Eclipse instance will be launched and allows to test drive the editor.</p>

<p>Before you can create a file for the sample language, you will have to create a sample project. Select <em>File → New → Project…</em> and choose a project type of your choice, e.g. <em>Java Project</em>, name it <em>Sample</em> and create a new file in the <em>src</em> folder of the project: From the context menu of the folder choose <em>New → File</em>, call it <em>Sample.mydsl</em> and hit <em>Finish</em>. The newly created editor will open for your language and ask you in a dialog, whether you want to add the Xtext nature to your project, which should be confirmed. You can now give the editor a try, e.g. use content assist (<em>Ctrl+Space</em>) to insert the keyword <code>Hello</code> and see how the input is validated immediately.</p>

<h2 id="five-minutes-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In your first five minutes with Xtext, you have learned how to create a new set of projects. You have run Xtext’s code generation in order to get a fully working language infrastructure, and finally learned how to test the generated editor.</p>

<p>Next up you should go through the more comprehensive <a href="102_domainmodelwalkthrough.html">Domain Model Example</a>. It explains the different concepts of the Xtext grammar language and illustrates how to customize various aspects of the language. </p>
